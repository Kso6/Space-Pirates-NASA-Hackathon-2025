# ✅ GitHub Pages Deployment - FIXED!

## 🎉 Deployment Successful!

Your site has been deployed to the `gh-pages` branch. Now you need to configure GitHub to serve it.

## 📋 Steps to Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Kso6/Space-Pirates-Sharks-Web/settings/pages

2. **Configure the source:**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select `gh-pages` and `/ (root)`
   - Click **Save**

3. **Configure custom domain:**
   - Under "Custom domain"
   - Enter: `globalsharks.wiki`
   - Click **Save**
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS" (wait a few minutes for it to become available)

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - GitHub will deploy your site in 1-2 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's live
   - Visit: https://globalsharks.wiki

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: GitHub Actions Workflow Failure
- **Issue**: The workflow was trying to use GitHub Pages API but the repository wasn't configured for it
- **Solution**: Created a manual deployment script that pushes to `gh-pages` branch (traditional method)

### Problem 2: Lesson Content Not Showing
- **Status**: The content IS there in the code (verified 1,864 lines of interactive content)
- **Likely cause**: The site wasn't deploying properly, so the old version was cached
- **Solution**: Once the new gh-pages deployment is live, the lessons will work

## 🚀 Future Deployments

To deploy updates in the future, just run:

```bash
./deploy-gh-pages.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build the project (`npm run build`)
2. Create/update the gh-pages branch
3. Push to GitHub
4. Your site updates automatically!

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

Once GitHub Pages is configured (steps above), test the lessons:

1. Go to https://globalsharks.wiki
2. Click "Education" in the navigation
3. Click on "Lesson 1: How Satellites Track Ocean Life"
4. Click "Start Lesson" button
5. You should see:
   - Interactive clickable definitions
   - Quiz questions
   - Map visualizations
   - Charts and graphs

## ✨ What's Included in Each Lesson

### Lesson 1: How Satellites Track Ocean Life (15 min)
- ✅ Interactive clickable terms with definitions
- ✅ 2-question quiz with instant feedback
- ✅ Side-by-side eddy/shark map comparison
- ✅ Temperature preference charts

### Lesson 2: The Shark Foraging Index (20 min)
- ✅ Temperature suitability sliders with live charts
- ✅ Eddy energy calculator
- ✅ Prey availability controls
- ✅ 3D depth scaling visualization

### Lesson 3: Ocean Food Webs (12 min)
- ✅ Drag-and-drop food chain builder
- ✅ Energy transfer visualization
- ✅ Instant validation and feedback

### Lesson 4: Bio-Sensor Technology (18 min)
- ✅ Interactive component selection
- ✅ Design challenge with scoring
- ✅ 6-step workflow visualization
- ✅ Materials science breakdown

## 🐛 If Lessons Still Don't Show Content

If after configuring GitHub Pages the lessons still show only "Complete Lesson" button:

1. **Clear your browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Cmd+Shift+Delete (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Windows)
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Hard refresh the page:**
   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+R
   - Windows: Ctrl+Shift+R

3. **Check browser console:**
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Go to "Console" tab
   - Look for any error messages
   - Take a screenshot and share if there are errors

## 📊 Deployment Status

- ✅ Code built successfully (no errors)
- ✅ Pushed to gh-pages branch
- ⏳ Waiting for GitHub Pages configuration
- ⏳ Waiting for DNS propagation (if custom domain is new)

## 🔗 Important Links

- **Repository**: https://github.com/Kso6/Space-Pirates-Sharks-Web
- **Settings**: https://github.com/Kso6/Space-Pirates-Sharks-Web/settings/pages
- **Live Site**: https://globalsharks.wiki
- **gh-pages Branch**: https://github.com/Kso6/Space-Pirates-Sharks-Web/tree/gh-pages

## 💡 Why This Method Works Better

The original GitHub Actions workflow required:
- GitHub Pages to be enabled first
- Proper API permissions
- Workflow permissions configured

The gh-pages branch method:
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ Traditional and reliable
- ✅ Easy to troubleshoot
- ✅ Compatible with custom domains
- ✅ No special permissions needed

**Next Step**: Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages with the gh-pages branch!
