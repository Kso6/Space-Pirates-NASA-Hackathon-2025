# 🚀 Interactive Intro Journey - Like QuakeHeroes but YC-Startup Style

## What We Built

Inspired by the [QuakeHeroes](https://gabrielchayb.github.io/42-quake-heroes/) engaging storytelling approach, we created an **interactive intro journey** for Global Sharks that combines:

- ✅ **Story-driven progression** (like QuakeHeroes)
- ✅ **Clean YC-startup aesthetic** (modern, professional)
- ✅ **Educational narrative** about sharks and satellites
- ✅ **Smooth animations** and transitions
- ✅ **Skip option** for returning users
- ✅ **Progress indicators** for navigation

## 🎬 The 5-Slide Journey

### Slide 1: Welcome

**Visual:** Large animated shark icon in a glowing gradient box

**Content:**

- Team branding: "Global Sharks" + "Team Space Pirates"
- NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025
- Tagline: "Join us on a journey to predict shark behavior"
- Sets the tone: Professional yet approachable

**Design:** Pulsing gradient effects, clean typography

---

### Slide 2: Connecting to Satellites

**Visual:** Animated Earth with orbiting satellite, signal waves

**Content:**

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Components

**`IntroJourney.jsx`**

- Main container component
- 5 slide components: `WelcomeSlide`, `ConnectingSlide`, `ProblemSlide`, `SolutionSlide`, `MissionSlide`
- Navigation state management
- Transition animations
- Progress tracking

**Helper Components:**

- `ProblemCard` - Statistics display with gradient numbers
- `SolutionCard` - Numbered feature boxes with hover effects
- `Badge` - Pill-shaped badges for features

### App Integration

**`App.jsx` changes:**

```javascript
const [showIntro, setShowIntro] = useState(true)

useEffect(() => {
  const hasSeenIntro = localStorage.getItem('hasSeenIntro')
  if (hasSeenIntro === 'true') setShowIntro(false)
}, [])

if (showIntro) {
  return <IntroJourney onComplete={handleIntroComplete} />
}
```

**localStorage:**

- Key: `hasSeenIntro`
- Value: `'true'` after completion
- Cleared when user clicks replay button

### Performance Optimizations

**Lazy Loading:**

- Main pages lazy loaded (Education, Viz, Model, Tag, About)
- Intro loads immediately (not lazy) for instant experience
- Suspense wrapper with loading spinner

**Error Boundary:**

- Catches React errors gracefully
- Shows friendly error message with reload option
- Prevents app crashes
