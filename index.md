## 📖 Project Overview

**Sharks from Space** revolutionizes marine conservation by combining NASA satellite technology with innovative bio-sensor systems to predict and validate shark foraging behavior. Our integrated approach addresses critical gaps in understanding apex predator ecology and ocean ecosystem dynamics.

### 🎯 The Challenge

Earth's ocean is one of the most powerful habitats in our universe, supporting a range of life that sustains ecosystems and habitability across the globe. While it's common to measure photosynthetic activity in the ocean from space, tracking top predators like sharks remains challenging.

Our challenge was to create:

1. A mathematical framework for identifying sharks and predicting their foraging habitats using NASA satellite data
2. A conceptual model of a tag that could measure not only where sharks are, but also what they are eating, and transmit that data in real time

### 💡 Our Solution

A three-pronged integrated system:

1. **📐 Mathematical Model** - 3D Shark Foraging Index (SFI)
2. **🗺️ Data Visualization** - Real-time NASA satellite data
3. **🔬 Tag Sensor** - Novel gastric bio-sensor technology

## 🚀 Why Sharks Matter

Sharks are critical apex predators that regulate prey levels and ensure species diversity needed for healthy ecosystems. However, they face unprecedented fishing pressure, with over 100 million sharks killed annually compared to just 5 human deaths from sharks.

### Educational Impact

Our platform teaches high school students and the broader community:

- The ecological importance of sharks in ocean ecosystems
- How NASA satellite data can track and predict marine life
- The connection between physical oceanography and marine biology
- How technology can support conservation efforts

### Human Decision Making

Improved shark location predictions affect human decisions by:

- Informing marine protected area design and implementation
- Reducing human-shark conflicts through better beach safety protocols
- Supporting sustainable fisheries management to minimize shark bycatch
- Guiding eco-tourism activities to observe sharks responsibly
