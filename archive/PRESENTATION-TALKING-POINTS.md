# Presentation Talking Points - Education Focus

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

> "Imagine a high school student in **any country** being able to use **real NASA satellite data** to predict where sharks will hunt tomorrow. Not for research. Not for profit. But to **learn ocean science**, **protect marine life**, and **keep communities safe**."

## Why This Matters (Answering the Challenge Brief) (2 minutes)

### "Why do sharks matter?"

**For Students to Understand:**

1. **Ecosystem Health** 🌊

   - Sharks are apex predators that regulate entire food webs
   - Without them, fish populations collapse
   - **70% of ocean ecosystems** depend on shark balance

2. **Climate Indicators** 🌍

   - Shark behavior reflects ocean health
   - Tracking them shows us **climate change impacts**
   - **100 million years** of evolutionary wisdom

3. **Human Coexistence** 🏖️
   - Only **5 humans die** from shark encounters per year
   - Yet **100 million sharks** are killed by humans
   - **Knowledge replaces fear** with safe coexistence

### "How do predictions affect human decisions?"

**Real-World Scenarios Students Learn:**

1. **Beach Safety Manager**

   - Receives alert: High shark activity near beach
   - **Decision:** Temporary closure or warning signs
   - **Outcome:** Safer beaches + Protected sharks

2. **Commercial Fisher**

   - Sees predicted hotspots before setting out
   - **Decision:** Avoid high shark areas
   - **Outcome:** Reduced bycatch + Better catch

3. **Marine Biologist**

   - Identifies critical foraging zones
   - **Decision:** Propose new protected area
   - **Outcome:** Healthier ecosystems + Biodiversity

4. **High School Student**
   - Accesses free data and tools
   - **Decision:** Run their own analysis for science fair
   - **Outcome:** Next-gen scientist + Public awareness
