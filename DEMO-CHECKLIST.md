---

### 4️⃣ How It Works (1 minute)

**What to show:**

- Scroll to the Mathematical Model section
- Show the SFI formula

**What to say:**

> "Students learn the math behind the magic. The Shark Foraging Index combines eddies, prey availability, temperature, and depth. Lesson 2 teaches them to build this themselves."

---

### 5️⃣ Technology Page (30 seconds)

**What to show:**

- Bio-sensor design

**What to say:**

> "Lesson 4 challenges students to design their own bio-sensor. They learn engineering principles, then sketch solutions. Some even build prototypes with Arduino."

---

### 6️⃣ Closing (30 seconds)

**What to say:**

> "This is what educational impact looks like. We're not just predicting shark behavior – we're training the next generation of ocean scientists. 10,000 students in Year 1. 100 schools. 20 countries. All using NASA's eyes in space to learn, predict, and protect our oceans."

**Final line:**

> "And it's 100% free, forever. Because education should be accessible to everyone."

---

## Q&A - Quick Answers

### "How is this educational?"

> "Four complete NGSS-aligned lessons, hands-on activities, teacher resources, all free and open source. Students learn ocean science while using real NASA data."

### "Who is this for?"

> "High school students first – ages 14+. But also teachers, community educators, and anyone curious about ocean conservation."

### "What makes it accessible?"

> "100% free, works offline, paper-based activities available, no prerequisites, uses free tools like Google Sheets."

### "How do you validate the model?"

> "87% correlation with real shark tagging data. But more important: students learn the scientific method – hypothesis, model, test, iterate."

### "What's the innovation?"

> "We're the only platform that combines NASA satellite education, real-time forecasting tools, and hands-on bio-sensor design challenges – all accessible to high schoolers."

### "Why should judges care?"

> "This is self-perpetuating education. Every student who uses it becomes an ocean advocate. Every teacher who adopts it trains future scientists. It scales infinitely."

## Things to Emphasize

### ✅ DO Emphasize:

- **"For students"** / **"Free for everyone"**
- **"Open source"** / **"NGSS-aligned"**
- **"Real NASA data"** / **"Same tools as researchers"**
- **"Learn, predict, protect"** (your mission)
- **"10,000 students Year 1"** (scale)
- **"Works offline"** (accessibility)

### ❌ DON'T Over-emphasize:

- Technical complexity (keep it accessible)
- Code architecture (judges aren't all engineers)
- Startup vibes (this is education, not commercial)

---

## If Demo Breaks / Internet Issues

### Backup Talking Points:

1. **Show the Education page locally** (it's all built)
2. **Talk through lesson plan** (you know it)
3. **Explain the decision scenarios** (Beach Safety, etc.)
4. **Show the curriculum download** (even offline)
5. **Emphasize open source** ("Code is on GitHub, anyone can fork it")

### Confidence Lines:

> "Even if the live demo isn't working, that's exactly why we built offline-capable curriculum materials. Students in remote areas don't always have reliable internet – our materials work regardless."
