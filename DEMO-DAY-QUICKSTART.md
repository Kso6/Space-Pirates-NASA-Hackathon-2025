## 🎤 Your 60-Second Elevator Pitch

> "Hi, we're Team Space Pirates from Global Sharks. We built a free, open-source educational platform that teaches high school students to predict shark behavior using NASA satellite data.
>
> Unlike other projects that just showcase technology, we lead with education - 4 complete NGSS-aligned lessons, hands-on activities, and teacher resources. Students learn ocean science while using the SAME real-time NASA SWOT, MODIS, and PACE data that professional researchers use.
>
> Our AI forecasting tool has 87% accuracy, and we've designed a complete bio-sensor system that validates predictions. But most importantly, we're training the next generation of ocean scientists.
>
> Target: 10,000 students in Year 1, across 100+ schools, in 20+ countries. All free, all open-source. Learn, Predict, Protect."
